Additionally, I've implemented CI/CD with GitHub so that whenever someone commits an update to our GitHub repository, the site automatically rebuilds itself, syncs build files into an S3 bucket, and commits the build files into a separate repository that serves as the source for the production website. The GitHub action can also be triggered on the backend so that the site will be rebuilt with the latest backend content. The website is accessible only within the US.",
